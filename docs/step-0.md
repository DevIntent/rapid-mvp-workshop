# Introduction

## Angular CLI
We're going to get started here by using a generic project created by the [Angular CLI](cli.angular.io).
This allows us to scaffold out a project and all of the build configuration automatically.

## StackBlitz
In order to avoid installing and configuring tools on your laptop, we're going to use 
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com). StackBlitz is an online IDE that integrates with many of the
tools relevant to Angular projects (GitHub, TypeScript, Angular CLI, Webpack, NodeJS, SASS, etc.).
Additionally, StackBlitz provides code completion and other editor features via VS Code and other
custom extensions.

## Getting Started
1. Open [Step 0 in Stackblitz](http://stackblitz.com/github/devintent/rapid-mvp-workshop/tree/step-0)
